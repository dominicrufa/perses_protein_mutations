# perses_protein_mutations
a collection of ipython notebooks attempting to resurrect and complete protein mutations.

the minimal working examples are as follows:
>  `protein_test_mappings.ipynb` attempts to generate a 19x19 protein mutation map (including topology proposals, geometry proposals, and hybrid system creations) for dipeptides.

>  `protein_test_mutation.ipynb` attempts to run vacuum and tip3p replica exchange free energy simulations from alanine dipeptide to valine dipeptide; both appear to be converging without instabilities

the working PR in https://github.com/choderalab/perses to run this code is found here: https://github.com/choderalab/perses/pull/618
